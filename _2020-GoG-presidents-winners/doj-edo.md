The team implemented a firearm appeal process, the Electronic Departmental Order (eDO), allowing the public to submit requests to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and receive responses electronically. The eDO has improved customer experience by reducing customer response times from 18 weeks to less than one week (95% improvement) for record requests and from two weeks to as little as two minutes for reason for firearm denial requests when submitting electronically. 60% of the firearm appeals are completely "lights out," requiring no human intervention. This ensures completion of the appeal process within the 60-day mandated time frame. The eDO has enabled an efficient reallocation of FBI resources through the reduction of staffing from 75 to 20 employees for record requests and from 75 to 30 employees for firearm appeals. This equates to cost savings of $3.4 million yearly for record requests and $750,000 yearly for firearm appeals. The teamâ€™s work in the development and implementation of the appeal process via the eDO system has streamlined processes, eliminated waste, reduced costs, and significantly reduced processing times while demonstrating a better use of taxpayer dollars.
