There is significant demand for continuing education and training for active public service practitioners. Many full-time working professionals seek to sharpen and build critical skills around the use of data to solve problems and achieve mission goals. These practitioners recognize that the more government can collect, analyze, and lead with quality data, the better the results for citizens and residents.

As winners of one of three [Government Effectiveness Advanced Research (GEAR) Center Challenge](https://www.performance.gov/GEARcenter/) grand prizes in 2019, the Volcker Alliance, the Centers for Civic Impact at Johns Hopkins University (Civic Impact), and the Mid-America Regional Council (MARC) set out to train federal practitioners in the Kansas City region in data management, performance management, and communicating with data. The effort was extremely well received by federal learners and surfaced insights about how to approach training at scale.

**What We Did**
After working with agency leaders to articulate learning goals, Civic Impact developed eighteen unique courses, including instructor-facilitated and self-guided courses. In response to the pandemic, Civic Impact quickly adapted the in-person training to an online format and offered additional online data courses. Despite the disruption of COVID-19, federal learners showed an especially high level of interest in this training opportunity. 

From January 2020 through October 2020, 159 federal practitioners from 24 agencies completed at least one course offered by the GEAR Center Challenge training program. Many completed multiple courses. A total of 321 federal learners enrolled in the trainings, completing an overall total of 376 courses.  

**What We Learned**

*Agency leadership buy-in is critical.*
