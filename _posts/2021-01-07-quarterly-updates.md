**January 7, 2021** - Today, we published progress updates for both Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals and Agency Priority Goals (APGs) for Quarter 4 of FY2020. These updates highlight recent milestones and accomplishments as well as related initiatives that support progress towards a more modern and effective government.

In addition to this quarter’s CAP Goal and APG progress updates, we’ve included several highlights from the past year that showcase cross-agency efforts to advance mission, service, and stewardship on behalf of the American people.

### Cross-Agency Priority Goal Highlights

**Improving Customer Experience**

In partnership with the U.S. Digital Service and the Office of Personnel Management, the [Customer Experience (CX) CAP Goal](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/cx/) team piloted a [government-wide hiring effort](https://www.performance.gov/CX-hiring-pilot/) this year to help recruit and hire specialized CX talent. More than 800 applicants applied for 30 new “CX Strategist” positions across more than a dozen agencies. The team kicked off a pilot cohort of 18 highly-qualified CX professionals, many of whom are experts from outside of the Federal Government.

**Results-Oriented Accountability for Grants**

As part of the cross-agency initiative to maximize the value of grant funding, the [Grants CAP Goal team](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/grants/) published the [Performance Management Playbook](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/innovation-sessions/Managing%20for%20Results,%20Performance%20Management%20Playbook%20for%20Federal%20Awarding%20Agencies.pdf) to help agencies move toward a results-oriented grants management culture. The playbook also informed the August 2020 revisions to [Title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/08/13/2020-17468/guidance-for-grants-and-agreements), another key accomplishment which further sets the stage for enhanced results-oriented accountability for grants.

**Shifting from Low-Value to High-Value Work**

The General Services Administration and the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Community of Practice released the [State of Federal RPA report](https://digital.gov/pdf/state-of-federal-rpa.pdf) in November 2020, which reported nearly 200% growth in RPA use among 23 agencies surveyed. This increase in adoption shows significant progress toward the Shifting from [Low-Value to High-Value Work CAP Goal](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/low-value-to-high-value-work/) and its efforts to reduce administrative burden across government.

**Developing a Workforce for the 21st Century**

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) launched a Reskilling Academy Pilot as an initiative under the [Workforce CAP Goal](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/workforce/) to provide new career opportunities for employees. After the six-week training course, employees are fully certified and qualified to enter new full-time jobs in roles that directly support the IRS’ mission to expand and strengthen support for taxpayers.
