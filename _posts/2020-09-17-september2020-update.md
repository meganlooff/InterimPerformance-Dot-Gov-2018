**September 17, 2020** - Today, we published progress updates for both Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals and Agency Priority Goals (APGs) for the third quarter of FY2020. These updates highlight recent milestones and accomplishments as well as related initiatives that support progress towards a more modern and effective government.

In addition to this quarter's CAP Goal and APG progress updates, we’ve included several highlights from the past fiscal year that showcase cross-agency efforts to advance mission, service, and stewardship on behalf of the American people.

**Highlights: CAP Goals**

*[Category Management](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/category-management/)*

Through the work of the Category Management CAP Goal, the Federal Government has made significant progress in streamlining how they buy common goods and services as an enterprise. Since the beginning of FY16, this effort has  avoided more than $33 billion in costs and is expected to increase to $40 billion by the end of FY20, eliminating nearly $150,000, or 35%, of duplicative or sub-optimized contracts.

In addition, to assist in the federal COVID-19 response, efforts were made to increase the use of 3D technology for the creation of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). This was possible thanks to suppliers on the GSA Schedule who successfully added several PPE items to their contracts within days instead of the typical contract modification time.

*[Modernize IT to Increase Productivity and Security](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/it-mod/) & [Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/CAP_goal_2.html)*

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many Federal Government services have utilized capabilities included in the President’s Management Agenda (PMA) to quickly embrace an environment of maximum digital engagement and continue meeting the mission and service expectations for their agency. Both the IT Modernization and Data CAP Goals have been instrumental in helping agencies make this rapid shift and create the foundation for an agile and responsive government.

The [Federal Data Strategy Action Plan](https://strategy.data.gov/action-plan/), released late 2019, has enabled the government to better curate, use, and share operational data during the pandemic as agencies were asked to increase responsiveness to citizen services. Outlined as a milestone in the plan, the Data CAP Goal will support the increase of open government data by first categorizing priority data sets that are considered valuable to the public interest. More information is scheduled to be published on their [site](https://strategy.data.gov/) later this year.

*[Developing a Workforce for the 21st Century](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/workforce/)*

 On July 31st, OPM issued initial guidance to agencies in support of the [Executive Order 13932](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/07/01/2020-14337/modernizing-and-reforming-the-assessment-and-hiring-of-federal-job-candidates). The order and associated guidance emphasizes a focus on skills and competency over degree-based hiring.

**Agency Priority Goals**

Agency progress reports are now available, and include exciting updates on efforts to bring broadband to rural areas (U.S. Department of Agriculture) and protect families from lead-based paint (Department of Housing and Urban Development). Stay tuned over the coming months as we highlight these and other agency efforts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PerformanceGov) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/performance-gov/).
