**July 6, 2020** - Today, we published progress updates for both Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals and Agency Priority Goals (APGs) for the first and second quarters of FY 2020. CAP Goal teams and federal agencies continue to make progress on implementation strategies critical to advancing the mission, service, and stewardship outcomes of the President’s Management Agenda (PMA) along with their FYs 2020-2021 APGs while also being able to shift emphasis and focus to COVID-19 response efforts. This post highlights some recent updates to CAP Goal implementation as well as milestones and accomplishments across several initiatives that support progress towards a more modern and effective government.

### Update on the President’s Management Agenda

**Institutionalizing CAP Goals**

When CAP Goals have achieved a level of maturity and implementation that enables those teams to (a) demonstrate and scale the impact and (b) institutionalize these reforms, it becomes appropriate to refocus their activities from planning toward demonstrating results. The following CAP Goals have achieved a level of maturity and implementation that enables a shift in focus from planning towards demonstrating results. These goals will continue to be tracked on Performance.gov and will report implementation outcomes and progress.

- [Modernizing the Infrastructure Permitting Process](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/permitting/)
- [Getting Payments Right](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/getting-payments-right/)
- [Security Clearance, Suitability, and Credentialing Reform](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/security-clearance-reform/)

Other adjustments have also been made to the PMA to match the current management landscape. Of particular note, a new [Frictionless Acquisition CAP Goal](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/frictionless-acquisition/) has been introduced.  This CAP Goal subsumes the work of Improve Management of Major Acquisitions CAP Goal and emphasizes breaking down barriers to entry to enable just-in-time delivery and greater resiliency of the federal contracting base. This CAP Goal brings together initiatives to modernize acquisition in three work streams: (1) business models and practices that focus on reduced acquisition lead-times, increased customer self-service, and trusted partnerships with both small and large business contractors;  (2) a “hi-definition” acquisition information environment that supports the modernized collection, analysis, availability, and visualization of acquisition data for smarter and faster mission decision-making; and (3) a vision for the workforce of tomorrow where acquisition professionals leverage technological advances to deliver the best customer service and mission support.

In addition, the [Federal IT Spending Transparency CAP Goal](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/tbm/) will be folded into the [IT Modernization](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/it-mod/); [Data, Accountability, and Transparency](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/leveragingdata/); and [Category Management](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/category-management/) CAP Goals. Read more about this shift in an upcoming blog post about Technology Business Management.

**COVID-19 Response**

The collective shift in focus to the federal COVID-19 response this past spring afforded opportunities to demonstrate the flexibility and adaptability of agency management processes to meet a changed operating environment. For example, in May we published an update from Federal CIO Suzette Kent on how [PMA Tech Initiatives Support COVID-19 Rapid Response](https://www.performance.gov/PMA-tech-initiatives-support-rapid-response-to-COVID19/). We will continue to highlight COVID-19 response efforts on Performance.gov and continue to feature the many ways agencies are leveraging PMA initiatives to overcome the management challenges presented by COVID-19.

**Permitting Scorecard Updates**

As part of the Modernize Infrastructure Permitting CAP Goal, [agency accountability scorecards](https://www.permits.performance.gov/scorecard) for the first two quarters of FY 2020 are available to view. Permitting scorecards evaluate agency performance and overall progress in processing environmental reviews and authorization decisions for major infrastructure projects.

**Customer Experience Hiring Pilot**

In April, the [Customer Experience (CX) CAP Goal](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/cx/) team launched a hiring pilot to attract more CX talent to the Federal Government. More than 800 applicants applied for 30 new “CX Strategist” positions across more than a dozen agencies. Twenty Subject Matter Experts reviewed, interviewed, and selected a cohort of amazing talent in six weeks.

### Agency Priority Goals

Agencies released implementation action plans for new, or continuing, APGs on Performance.gov that reflect the performance commitments for the next two years in priority policy and management areas.


### Performance Framework - Strategic Objectives Dashboard

The new Strategic Objectives Dashboard displays the latest agency strategic objectives in an interactive, easy-to-view way. Strategic objectives are set by agencies to advance the long-term outcomes identified in the Agency Strategic Plan, and are supported by more specific performance goals and indicators.
