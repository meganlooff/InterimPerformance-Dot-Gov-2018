In honor of National Women’s Small Business Month, we’ve partnered with SBA’s *Office of Government Contracting and Business Development* and *Office of Program Performance, Analysis, and Evaluation* to highlight the Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSBs) data dashboard! According to the [U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ase.html), the U.S. has nearly 1.1 million women-owned businesses with 99.9% of them categorized as small businesses. In FY19, more than $25 billion was awarded to WOSBs, as the Federal Government met the goal of **awarding five percent of all federal contracting dollars** to women-owned small businesses each year.

This dashboard features five years of data which can be broken down into visuals by agency, state, and fiscal year. The location data is a unique feature -- specifically, the congressional district-level information, as no other visualization shows this level of information. Users can also see investment in their industry by looking at spend by category in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) table.
