**September 17, 2020** - Today, we published progress updates for both Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals and Agency Priority Goals (APGs) for the third quarter of FY2020. These updates highlight recent milestones and accomplishments as well as related initiatives that support progress towards a more modern and effective government.

**Highlights: CAP Goals**

*[Category Management](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/category-management/)*

To assist in the federal COVID-19 response, efforts were made to increase the use of 3D technology for the creation of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). In addition, suppliers on the GSA Schedule added several PPE items to their contracts within days instead of the typical contract modification time.

*[Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/CAP_goal_2.html)*

Outlined as a milestone in the [2020 Federal Data Strategy Action Plan](https://strategy.data.gov/action-plan/), the team began efforts to categorize high-value data as a way to increase public transparency.

*[Developing a Workforce for the 21st Century](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/workforce/)*

In the ongoing effort to reform the workforce, the President has signed multiple executive orders. On July 31, OPM issued initial guidance to agencies in support of the [Executive Order 13932](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/07/01/2020-14337/modernizing-and-reforming-the-assessment-and-hiring-of-federal-job-candidates). The order and associated guidance emphasizes a focus on skills and competency over degree-based hiring. 

**Agency Priority Goals**

Agencies released progress reports on their agency-specific goals. Reports are now available on the site, and include exciting updates on efforts to bring broadband to rural areas (USDA) and protect families from lead-based paint (HUD). Stay tuned over the coming months as we highlight these and other Agency efforts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PerformanceGov) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/performance-gov/).
