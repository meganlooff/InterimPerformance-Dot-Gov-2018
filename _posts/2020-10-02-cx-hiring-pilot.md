The federal government needs customer experience (CX) and design professionals. These experts ensure the public receives well designed, more efficient services.  Given that each agency only wanted to hire a few CX professionals and that effective assessments take time to administer, the government recently experimented with a new way to hire effectively in the competitive service. Rather than each agency doing separate job announcements only using a self-assessment questionnaire, in this action, 20 CX experts across 9 federal departments decided to work together on one shared job announcement. The goal was to qualify and effectively assess all applicants so that we could try to place every single qualified applicant somewhere in the government.

This hiring experiment- moving away from the self-assessment questionnaire and toward subject matter expert based assessments- reflects the broader Presidentâ€™s Management Agenda to improve hiring outcomes as well as a recent Executive Order that requires agencies to use qualifying assessments other than the self-assessment questionnaire. Although there have been 7 successful SME-based qualifying assessment pilots in the last year, this marks the first pilot that was government-wide. Today, the majority job announcements use qualifying assessments outside the self-assessment questionnaire so this pilot helped show an example of how agencies can think outside the box to fill competitive openings with top technical talent. 

This pilot proved that within 6 weeks of positing a job announcement, hiring managers can be presented with a list of truly qualified applicants, with qualified veterans at the top of that list. Thus far, of the 44 applicants who qualified at the GS13, 14, and 15 levels, exactly half have been selected by an agency and 17 have accepted their offer. The feedback from hiring managers and applicants alike has been overwhelmingly positive. This post will dig into the details of what this took and what needs to happen moving forward to continue this work.


The pilot

This undertaking required significant coordination and expertise. USDS had been partnering with OPM for the past year to codify that this type of approach- having SME partnering with HR to write the qualifications and pass/fail assessments to measure those qualifications- is allowed within competitive hiring laws and regulations. This approach- known as Subject Matter Expert Qualification Assessment (SME-QA) is now documented in the OPM HR hiring handbook and in OPM Policy Memos. This strategy ensures only qualified applicants make it through the competitive hiring action, with the goal of selections off every job announcement that is open to the public. If we advertise a job publically, we should make a selection off that announcement.

To coordinate the hiring action, USDS and the cross-agency Federal Customer Experience Team joined forces with OPM Staff Acquisition to make this hiring action a success. As reflected in the hiring diagram below, this hiring strategy requests Subject Matter Experts to sit with HR professionals for two days to document the required specialized experience in the form of competencies and proficiency levels. Next they create pass fail assessments to evaluate applicants against those requirements. Only applicants who pass both assessments are eligible for the position. Veterans preference is only reviewed at the end of the applicants who remain eligible after qualifying assessments are complete.
