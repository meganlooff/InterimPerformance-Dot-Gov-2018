Teams implementing the federal government’s high-priority performance initiatives released their December 2018 quarterly updates for both Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals and Agency Priority Goals (APGs). These updates showcase recently completed and upcoming milestones as teams continue to use these goals to advance mission, service, and stewardship outcomes on behalf of the American people.

For more information about why goal teams provide quarterly updates, please visit the [Performance Framework](../about/framework_about.html) page, which includes an explanation of [CAP Goals](../about/CAP_about.html) and [APGs](../about/APG_about.html).

### Highlights from the CAP Goal and APG Progress Updates

Through the program, existing Federal employees expand their skills to become qualified cyber defense analysts and help defend against cyber threats.

#### [CAP Goal: Category Management - Leveraging Common Contracts and Best Practices to Drive Savings and Efficiencies](../CAP/CAP_goal_7.html)

<img src="../img/CAP_icons/Icon_Category_Management_twitter.png" style="width:15%;float:left;margin-right:20px;" alt="CAP goal icon">Category management continues to deliver value and savings to taxpayers by allowing the government to buy commons goods and services as a single enterprise. In fiscal year (FY) 2018, category management <strong>generated $9.3 billion in cost avoidance across agencies</strong>, not yet including Department of Defense's data that will be finalized in January.

#### [CAP Goal: Developing a Workforce for the 21st Century](../CAP/CAP_goal_3.html)

<img src="../img/CAP_icons/Icon_Workforce_twitter.png" style="width:15%;float:left;margin-right:20px;" alt="CAP goal icon">National Science Foundation (NSF) is <strong>helping federal employees better position themselves for the 21st century workforce</strong>. NSF launched the [Career Compass Challenge](https://challenge.gov/a/buzz/challenge/86/ideas/top), a $100,000 cash prize competition for researchers, educators, developers and private sector to develop an innovative reskilling tool that prepares employees for current and future career opportunities.

Federal agencies can now <strong>fill critical positions with qualified candidates faster</strong>. The Office of Personnel Management authorized new direct hire appointing authorities that agencies can use immediately to hire for a variety of Scientific, Technical, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) positions, as well as Cybersecurity and related positions which have identified severe shortages of candidates and/or critical hiring needs.

In FY18, the FBI dismantled 194 gangs or criminal enterprises, exceeding their target goal by 15% and helping communities across the country live safer lives.

#### [APG: Environmental Protection Agency: Accelerate the Pace of Cleanups and Return Sites to Beneficial Use in Their Communities](../EPA/APG_epa_2.html)

<img src="../img/agency/Environmental_Protection_Agency_Seal.png" style="width:15%;float:left;margin-right:20px;" alt="agency seal">Brownfields present risks to human health and the environment.
