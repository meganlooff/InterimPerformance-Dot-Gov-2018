As we reflect on the third year of the President’s Management Agenda and Cross-Agency
Priority Goal on Improving Customer Experiences with Federal Services, we recognize both the
history around this journey and how excited we are about the road ahead. This year felt like
another big stepping stone for the further integration of Customer Experience (CX) as a function
of government as 25 High Impact Service Providers (HISPs) continue to develop new
capabilities, our team launched several new initiatives and programs, and we work to lay the
groundwork for further progress.

## Continued progress on A11 Section 280

This past year our HISPs completed their second year of the annual activities outlined in
[OMB Circular A-11 Section 280]({{ site.baseurl }}/cx/assets/files/a11-280.pdf).
According to [Forrester’s US Federal Customer Experience Index,
2020 report](https://www.forrester.com/report/The+US+Federal+Customer+Experience+Index+2020/-/E-RES162398),
the quality of the US federal customer experience achieved its highest scores ever
with the 15 US federal agencies and programs earning an average score of 61.1, a gain of 1.4
points over 2019. As we look ahead, both that report and our progress to date highlight while
we continue to improve CX outcomes, we continue to have a lot of opportunity in front of us.
With that in mind, the CX CAP Goal Team analyzed the collective HISP results from our annual
Capacity Assessments as well as reviewed our forward-looking Action Plans. We continue to
be inspired by the impressive public servants across government who are deeply connected to
their mission and the people that they serve.

## 2020 Maturity Assessments

The maturity assessment evaluates HISP capacity to manage customer experience on a
35-point scale across the five CX functions outlined in A-11 Section 280: Measurement,
Governance &amp; Strategy, Culture &amp; Organization, Customer Understanding, and Service
Design &amp; Improvement. This year the average score was

<b>There is an overall increase in survey and qualitative research activity.</b>
Nearly 80% of HISP’s reported actively surveying customer segments and/or building capability to capture data
and information. Several HISP’s are actively using [Touchpoints](https://touchpoints.digital.gov/), a survey tool provided by
GSA’s TTS to help make collecting feedback easier for agencies. The data and insights are
being used to inform program/product development, service delivery, and to better understand
opportunities to improve agency effectiveness. You can read more about what we’ve learned
from this analysis in our reflection on FY20 feedback data.

<b>Access to the right skills and talent was again cited as one of the greatest capacity gaps.</b>
Having the right skills with the right experience is critical to maturing our CX capabilities. Several
HISPs that reported lack of staff with CX experience to be a barrier to effective implementation
particularly in areas around design and product development.

<b>Three is an increasing recognition of the connection between Employee Experience and
Customer Experience.</b> Many HISPs have found an intuitive place to start improving the
experience of their customers by tackling pain points felt by their employees. TSA and VA in
particular have begun exploring administrative, employee feedback, and customer feedback
data to identify specific locations for employee initiatives.

<b>It remains difficult to keep CX a focus among competing priorities.</b> Leadership continues to
be incentivized to focus on other items, and HISPs cite leadership engagement as the number
one item that enables their customer-focused work. Leadership support is often necessary for
shepherding information collection review requests through internal agency review processes,
hiring new types of talent, putting in upfront effort into customer understanding work, navigating
procurements in a more agile way, and other critical activities that cannot simply be “grass-
roots.”

## 2020 Action Plans

In addition to their annual assessments our HISP community also delivered a range of forward-
looking Action Plans, sharing individual progress and future plans with the public. Building upon
prior year efforts the Action Plans represent a variety of projects across our core functions with
different timelines and impacts. As we transition to more year over year reporting, we’ll continue
to recognize consistent areas of action across HISP’s (e.g. call center, process/digital, training,
governance) and highlight learnings, identify trends, and important milestones to ensure
consistent, continuous improvement..

Below is a snapshot and highlights cross functional opportunities being addressed by multiple
agencies with some examples within each:

<b>Call center improvements, adding functionality, and streamlining processes</b>

* Increase call back functionality to reduce wait times (Treasury/Internal Revenue
Service/Online Services)
* Reducing Average Speed of Answer times (SSA/Social Security Card Issuance/Processing, Retirement, SS Disability Benefits)

<b>Continued Implementation of customer experience surveys and feedback</b>

* Using feedback directly from employees to share learnings and improve outcomes (Dept
of State/Passport Services Office/Passport Issuance &amp; Processing)
* Leverage Touchpoints to ascertain if information is useful for the customer across channels (USDA, OSHA, DHS/CBP/Customs &amp; Entry Processing - Traveler Communication Center (TCC))
* Use feedback to develop report, data, and actions plans to better support transition
(VA/Veterans Benefits Administration/Veterans Pension Benefits &amp; Veterans Disability
Benefits)

<b>Further embedding CX in strategic planning activities and governance structure</b>

* Establishing governance to institutionalize CX across the agency including practice,
measures, and incentives (HUD, BTFA)

<b>Continue building CX training for employees</b>

* Develop robust training for field operations including communities of practice and
recognition (DHS/TSA/Airport Security Screening, VHA)
* Provide online training with site specific worksheets and planning documents (DOI/U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Services/Visitor Services)

<b>Process/Digital improvements</b>

* Building out an omnichannel customer experience including video verification for claims
(DHS/FEMA/Emergency and Disaster Relief)
* Direct access to claim and files and new digital/paper experience for recertification (Dept
of Ed/Student Financial Aid/Federal Student Aid)
* Transition from paper based to full scale integrated, digital journey (OPM/Retirement
Services)

Our team will continue to work with the HISPs in the coming months to identify any barriers to
implementation of the Plans. Progress will be tracked with the next HISP Action Plan update
expected to be published in Fall 2021.

## 2020 Cross-Government Initiatives

On top of individual agency efforts to implement A11 Section 280, our team oversaw and
partnered on the development of several new initiatives to support government-wide CX
adoption and growth. A few highlights include:

* The General Services Administration’s (GSA) Office of Customer Experience (OCE)
released the [Customer Experience Services Evaluation and Buying Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/cx/CX-Evaluation-and-Buying-Guide.pdf). This resource is intended to answer questions and provide guidance to agencies looking to
build their Customer Experience (CX) capacity through Human-centered Design (HCD)
support services.
* Working with USDS and OPM, our team also ran the [Customer Experience Hiring
Pilot](https://smeqa.usds.gov/info/cx-govwide/) through the first-ever government-wide SME-QA process to attract more CX talent
to the Federal Government. [More than 800 applicants applied for 30 new “CX Strategist”
positions]({{ site.baseurl }}/cx/blog/CX-hiring-pilot/) across more than a dozen agencies. Twenty Subject Matter Experts reviewed,
interviewed, and selected a cohort of amazing talent in six weeks. We recently kicked off
our pilot cohort of more than 18 outstanding individuals, many starting a role in Federal
service for the first time.
* Working with the Lab at OPM this summer, we developed and launched a new CX
training program called Amplify geared towards supporting Federal teams seeking to mature their customer understanding practices (one of the lowest-scoring functions
across all HISPs in both FY19 and FY20 CX maturity assessments). Quickly shifting its
entire format due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the program included remote town hall
convenings, six training modules with accompanying videos, remote coaching from Lab
Service Designers, and share-out forums. All of the modules will be accessible to federal
agencies on OMB Max. By focusing on understanding customer contexts and needs the
development of Federal products and services is more certain to meet their needs,
resulting in more positive experiences with those agencies. After reorienting the
program to be entirely virtual, it carried forward with six federal agencies and completed
in August.
* Working with GSA’s TTS Feedback Analytics team, we partnered with the leaders of 24
services, such as VA outpatient care and Farmers.gov, to build a [Cross Agency CX
Dashboard]({{ site.baseurl }}/cx/). The intent is to collect feedback from the public so we can better
understand what matters to them, target service improvements accordingly, and discuss
best practices to improve CX operations. We are now collecting more than 1.1 million
surveys per quarter. Correlation analysis on that data suggests ease of completing a
service online, and the efficiency or amount of time to do so strongly influence
satisfaction and trust. An update to performance.gov/CX on September 17 showcases
some of this data and we will continue to update this site to publish feedback data from
all the HISPs.

## What’s Next?

As we round out the year, the CX team is working on a few fronts to ensure we properly bridge
our current efforts with a clear roadmap to continue building service delivery and customer
experience management capabilities into agency operations, in the 2021 President’s
Management Agenda and beyond.

As part of these efforts the team is currently working on an extensive Federal strategy focused
on creating the next phase of bolder actions to take to transform public service delivery. As part
of this engagement, [we are developing two customer journey maps focused the ways in which
individuals with a disability and individuals surviving a disaster]({{ site.baseurl }}/cx/blog/2020-cx-maps/) must navigate public services –
both life are experiences that involve not just multiple Federal agencies, but multiple levels of
government. Through this research, we will highlight and identify areas in which structural,
budgetary, legal, cultural, and other barriers are preventing 21 st century service delivery.

Finally, we’re assessing a range of governance models (from Chief Experience Officers, Heads
of Products, or alignment of agencies around critical life events) that could help to provide
accountability for the ways in which the public actually experiences government. And, we want
to continue to update and refine A-11 Section 280, with leading practices in how mature CX and
service delivery organizations manage and measure themselves.

We’re very excited about the progress our HISP partners have made and the community of
practitioners actively supporting one another. The ability of our enterprise to continuously
improve based on customer feedback s will be critical to our service delivery efforts now and
into the future.
