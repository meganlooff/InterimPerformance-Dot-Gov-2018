      <p><b>Goal Statement:</b>

          Cybercrime is one of the greatest threats facing our country, and has enormous implications for our national security, economic prosperity, and public safety.  The range of threats and challenges cybercrime presents for law enforcement expands just as rapidly as technology evolves. By September 30, 2021, the Department of Justice will combat cybercrime threats and attacks by conducting 16,000 computer intrusion program deterrences, detections, disruptions and dismantlements; favorably resolving 90 percent of prosecutions of cyber defendants; and increasing the percentage of private sector losses recovered by the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) to 78 percent.  The results from FY 2018 (73%) currently serve as a baseline for the Department’s new IC3 measure. </p>
