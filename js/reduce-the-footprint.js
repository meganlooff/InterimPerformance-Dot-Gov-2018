Under the RTF policy, OMB has established government-wide policy to use property as efficiently as possible and to reduce agency portfolios though annual reduction targets. With the issuance of OMB Memorandum M-20-03 Implementation of Agency-wide Real Property Capital Planning, the CFO Act agencies are no longer required to submit annual Plans to OMB.
