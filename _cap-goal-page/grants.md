#***********************ACCORDION SECTION*****************************
statement: "Maximize the value of grant funding by applying a risk-based, data-driven framework that balances compliance requirements with demonstrating successful results for the American taxpayer. " #first accordion text

challenge: "The Federal government uses grants to invest approximately $700 billion each year in mission-critical needs for American taxpayers, but managers report spending 40% of their time using antiquated processes to monitor compliance instead of analyzing data to improve results. "

opportunity: "Standardize the grants management business process and identify, open, standardize, and link data. Use standard business process and data to identify opportunities to build shared solutions that reduce burden and improve the user experience. Leverage data, including data produced by annual audits, to assess and manage recipient risk. Hold recipients accountable for good performance practices that supports achievement of program goals and objectives and streamline burdensome compliance requirements for those that demonstrate results.
