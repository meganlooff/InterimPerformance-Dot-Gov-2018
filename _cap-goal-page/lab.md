#***********************FLOATING BOX SECTION*****************************

#***********************ACCORDION SECTION*****************************
statement: "This goal will:   improve the transition of federally funded innovations from the laboratory to the marketplace by reducing the administrative and regulatory burdens for technology transfer and increasing private sector investment in later-stage research and development (R&D); develop and implement more effective partnering models and technology transfer mechanisms for Federal agencies; and enhance the effectiveness of technology transfer by improving the methods for evaluating the ROI and economic and national security impacts of federally funded R&D, and using that information to focus efforts on approaches proven to work." #first accordion text

challenge: "The Federal Government invests approximately $150 billion annually in research and development (R&D) conducted at federal laboratories, universities, and other research organizations. For America to maintain its position as the global leader in innovation, bringing products to market more quickly, growing the economy, and maintaining a strong national security innovation base, it is essential to optimize technology transfer and support programs to increase the return on investment (ROI) from federally funded R&D." #second accordion text

opportunity: "There are opportunities to: identify regulatory impediments and administrative improvements in federal technology transfer policies and practices; increase engagement with private sector technology development experts and investors; build a more entrepreneurial R&D workforce; support innovative tools and services for technology transfer; improve understanding of global science and technology trends and benchmarks." #third accordion text
