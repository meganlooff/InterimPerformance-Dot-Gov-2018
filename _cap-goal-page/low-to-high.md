#***********************FLOATING BOX SECTION*****************************

#***********************ACCORDION SECTION*****************************
statement: "Goal Statement: Federal agencies will shift time, effort, and funding from low to high-value work through the elimination of unnecessary requirements, burden reduction, optimization and streamlining, and workload automation. Based on the 2020 Customer Satisfaction Survey, Federal employees on average spend an estimated 275 hours per year on work they consider low-value. Over the next two years we will work to reduce the government-wide average by 15%, which could reduce the total hours of low value work employees have identified by up to 25 million hours. " #first accordion text

challenge: "All Federal Agencies are charged with effective stewardship of taxpayer funds, a responsibility that requires both critical mission achievement and a continuous focus on improving operational efficiency. Time, energy, and resources spent performing repetitive, manual processes, and adhering to unnecessary and obsolete policies, hinders Agenciesâ€™ ability to achieve effective stewardship. Agencies must actively work to eliminate low value, legacy requirements that persist over time despite changes to the challenges they were intended to solve, optimize low value, manual processes that absorb time and resources, and leverage automation to create organizational capacity." #second accordion text

opportunity: "Federal Agencies can identify and streamline operational processes to improve the pursuit of mission outcomes and increase the effectiveness and efficiency of Government. " #third accordion text
