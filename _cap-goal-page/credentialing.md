#***********************ACCORDION SECTION*****************************
statement: "A Federal workforce entrusted to protect Government information and property and to promote a safe and secure work environment, sustained by an enhanced risk management approach. Supported by: Improved early detection enabled by an informed, aware, and responsible Federal workforce; quality decisions enabled by improved investigative and adjudicative capabilities; optimized government-wide capabilities through enterprise approaches; and strong partnership with Insider Threat Programs to strengthen the identification, deterrence, and mitigation of problems before they negatively impact the workforce or national security."

challenge: "The Government’s existing framework for establishing trust in the Federal civilian, military, and contracted workforce has struggled to onboard needed personnel efficiently and effectively, and to determine whether those workers can be consistently trusted to perform their duties and not to cause harm to people, property, systems, and information." #second accordion text

opportunity: "A Federal workforce that reliably protects Federal Government people, property, systems, and information through an enhanced risk management framework, which features:

Improved early detection, enabled by an informed, aware, and responsible Federal workforce;
Quality decisions, enabled by improved investigative and adjudicative capabilities;
Optimized government-wide capabilities through enterprise approaches; and
Strong partnership with Federal Insider Threat programs to identify, deter, and mitigate problems before they negatively impact the workforce or national security. " #third accordion text
