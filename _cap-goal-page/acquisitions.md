#***********************FLOATING BOX SECTION*****************************

#***********************ACCORDION SECTION*****************************
statement: "The Federal Government will deliver commercial items at the same speed as the market place & manage customers’ delivery expectations for acquisitions of non-commercial items by breaking down barriers to entry using modern business practices and technologies." #first accordion text

challenge: "Agencies face challenges in meeting their customers’ cost, schedule, and performance expectation: 
<ul><br/>
<li>The acquisition culture remains captive to norms and rules that reward compliance and risk avoidance over good business judgment and positive customer experience as agencies address their mission needs and work with each other to solve national problems.</li>
<li>Efforts center on creating a perfect contract, rather than a trusted partnership with shared common values.</li>
<li>Agencies gather billions of data points that are difficult to use, instead of exploiting  disruptive technologies to promote cost-effective self-service analytics & allow acquisition professionals to pursue higher value activities.</li>
<li>Metrics often drive stakeholders to think of acquisition as a mechanical activity, rather than as a value-enhancing platform or conduit for effective accomplishment of critical mission outcomes. </li>
<li>Major acquisitions experience shortfalls because program management is undervalued.</li>
</ul> 
" #second accordion text

opportunity: "Agencies will leverage advanced technology & best commercial & public sector practices to support a transformed acquisition environment where, by 2025:
<ul>
 <li>90% of routine, non-major acquisitions and 80% of complex major acquisitions are completed in a time frame and comparable to private sector averages or benchmarks of leading state and local governments, or federal agencies;</li>
 <li>The number of unique businesses receiving federal prime contracting dollars has increased by 15%;</li>
  <li>The number of  new entrant small businesses has increased by 30%;</li>
 <li>80% of customers & other internal and external stakeholders rate delivered service and experience with the acquisition process as above average or better; and</li>
 <li>75% of acquisition employees feel empowered and enabled to innovate on behalf of the taxpayers they serve.</li>
 </ul> " #third accordion text
