      <h1>Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal Overview</h1>
        <p>Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals have been established to drive implementation of the <a href="../PMA/PMA.html">President's Management Agenda (PMA)</a> and tackle critical government-wide challenges that cut across agencies. The CAP Goals provide the components of the Federal Government Performance Plan required by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, naming senior accountable officials and establishing concrete goals and trackable metrics to ensure public accountability for each of these goals.</p>
        <!--<p>These CAP goals will strengthen Federal Government management in priority areas of improving management of major acquisitions, reducing improper payments, increasing transparency of IT costs, enhancing accountability for grant spending, and purchasing across Government as an enterprise. CAP goal teams will also lead the execution of related Administration priorities, such as implementing the recommendations of the Report to the President on Federal IT Modernization focused on Network Modernization, Cybersecurity and Shared Services and also reforming security clearances and related processes for personnel.</p>-->
