<h1>Real Property Metrics</h1>
<p>The Federal Real Property Council (FRPC) is publishing a set of fiscal year 2019 real property metrics for Federal agencies. The <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-114publ318/pdf/PLAW-114publ318.pdf">The Federal Property Management Reform Act of 2016</a> requires that real property performance metrics be established. In addition, in the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/M-20-10.pdf">Office of Management and Budget M-20-10, Issuance of an Addendum to the National Strategy for the Efficient Use of Real Property</a>,
    Action 6 states that the government will establish and publish accountable annual performance metrics for all agencies. The FRPC has established a set of six real property metric categories:
    <ul>
    <li>Operating and Maintenance Costs per Square Foot</li>
    <li>Rent Costs per Square Foot</li>
    <li>Reduce the Footprint</li>
    <li>Condition Index</li>
    <li>Tenant Satisfaction Scores</li>
    <li>Square Feet per Person</li>
    </ul>

</p>

<p>Within each category there can be multiple metrics for each CFO act agency. To access the real property metrics category, click one of the red buttons below to reveal a description of the category and visualization.

<!--<h2>Reduce the Footprint Policy Results: FY 2019</h2>-->
<!--<p>In FY 2019 agencies reduced their office and warehouse space by  113,000  SF resulting in an estimated annual cost increase  of $30 million.  The small reduction in SF was not enough to offset scheduled increases in leases rates (i.e. annual inflation) resulting in a net cost increase relative to cost in FY 2018. Note that these figures exclude the short-term space the US Census Bureau acquired to execute the 2020 census. </p>-->

<!--<p>The FY 2019 results brings the FY 2016 â€“ FY 2019 results for the RTF policy to a 16.3 million SF reduction to office and warehouse space with an estimated annual cost avoidance of $136 million. </p>-->
