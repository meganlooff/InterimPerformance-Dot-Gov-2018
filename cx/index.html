        <strong><a href="https://www.performance.gov/mapping-cx-journey/">Veterans Employment</a></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
      Government typically approaches improvement and implementation from a bureaucratic, organizational-centered view. To better tackle barriers experienced by those leaving the military and entering the labor market, we built a journey map from the perspective of actual people living this moment – and showed how points at which multiple Federal agencies were involved were often also the most confusing to the user.

      </p>
      <p>
      Bringing Olympic National Park Wilderness permits onto recreation.gov has saved more than 5,000 staff hours in less than one year and has shifted the customer experience from burdensome time waiting in line, on the phone, sending faxes or emails, and enables visitors to know immediately whether their reservations are secured.

        <strong><a href="https://www.dmi.org/page/2015DVAOPM">The National School Lunch Program</a></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
      The National School Lunch Program provides low-cost or free lunches to 30 million children living at or below the poverty level each school day. On the customer side, the application process was very challenging, leaving out children that needed access to healthy meals. On the Federal side, there was a potential of 1.8 billion dollars in improper payments going back to schools. A journey mapping process led to a redesigned application form.
