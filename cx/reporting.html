<h3>
  Workflow for Data Submission, Summarization, and Publishing
</h3>

<p>
  Each HISP agency is responsible for reporting CX data on a quarterly basis,
  and this section outlines both the lifecycle of feedback data
  and the order of operations of how we process the data.
</p>

<h5>
  Agencies
</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    Each agency collects customer feedback on an ongoing basis.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each agency summarizes the latest quarter
    of feedback response data in a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cx/assets/files/CX-Feedback-Data-Submission.xlsx">spreadsheet template</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each agency submits the CX data via spreadsheet
    to the Federal CX Community page on <a href="https://community.max.gov/x/cQDMVw" target="_blank">OMB MAX</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>
  Feedback Analytics
</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    The Feedback Analytics team collects the data that HISP agencies submit to OMB Max.
  </li>
  <li>
    The team reviews the data and corresponds with an agency, if necessary.
  </li>
  <li>
    The team re-enters the data into the HISP 2020 Data Review spreadsheet
    for further analysis and calculations.
    <!-- this is the time intensive part -->
  </li>
  <li>
    .csv files are generated from the summary spreadsheet.
  </li>
  <li>
    The team posts the .csv files, which include:
    1. each agencies CX data and
    2. summarized data to https://performance.gov/cx.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  When the data is posted on https://performance.gov/cx,
  each HISP receives quarterly indicators for their data submitted.
  This is how those indicators are determined:
</p>
<p>
  Red = no data submitted
  <br>
  Yellow = data submitted, but not fully in-line with A-11 Section 280 Guidance
  <br>
  Green = data submitted, in-line with A-11 Section 280 Guidance
</p>
