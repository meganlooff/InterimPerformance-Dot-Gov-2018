Meet Claire. She has a moderate intellectual disability that was identified when she was four. She loves being involved in extracurricular activities at school, so this year with COVID-19 has been particularly challenging. Claire’s mom took off work for six weeks at the beginning of the lockdown to help her establish a new normal.

Claire’s mom applied for a Medicaid waiver when she was five, however it took Claire eight years to get off the waitlist. Claire receives Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and is learning how to drive with the help of waiver services. Over the summer, she works part-time at a local restaurant bussing tables. She’d like to take on more hours, but she’s “frustrated she can’t work more without losing SSI.” Her mother asked her to “stop working altogether to make sure she is able to receive SSI for life.” As the family is getting older, she “wants to make sure she’ll be ok if something happens to her.”

To Claire and her family, these are a series of decisions to make on what services are available to them. To the Federal Government, it triggers possible eligibility for programs spread across dozens of agencies, not to mention state and local government and charities. It might mean a Transition Plan from the U.S. Department of Education, a Support Coordinator from the County Boards of Developmental Disability, Supplemental Security Income from the Social Security Administration, Medicaid Waiver from the State Medicaid Office. Each has their own process, regulations, and paperwork.

People with disabilities and their families receive critical support from the government, interacting with agencies at the Federal, state, and local level. At times, this can be challenging for individuals and their families to understand the full scope of what support is available and to decide what is right for them. Individuals and their families must research, apply, and weave together support from each agency individually over the course of their life.

The federal government currently spends $70 Billion dollars annually across 45+ programs and 50+ delivery systems to assist 7 - 8 million people living with an intellectual disability.

This journey shows a person with an intellectual disability, who has limits in their ability to learn and function in daily life, transitioning from childhood to adulthood. This transition period has been described as a “cliff,” with the policies, protections, and supports provided during school
ending. This phase is full of big decisions that influence the rest of the person’s life, making it particularly challenging to navigate.

Orienting ourselves to the general process of an intellectually disabled person transitioning from the perspective of Centers of Medicare & Medicaid Services, Department of Education, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Labor, and Social Security Administration helped us identify subject matter experts and appropriate offices to interview.

We were fortunate to work with an outstanding team, many of whom have done previous design work, to build the critical first layer of qualitative customer data. 24 interviews with not only members of the public who were intellectually disabled, but also advocacy groups, service providers, family members, and government employees at various levels. We supplemented this research by collecting 334 responses from surveying the intellectual disability community with questions related to better understanding their experience navigating support services at the federal, state, and local levels. We compiled this data and used it in 5 iterative design sessions with 20+ federal employees involved in the disability support environment.

This journey map is a composite of the experiences of the people we spoke with, and shows the steps and support as they articulated them. This map has five sections:

At the top are the stages of transition a person with an intellectual disability goes through their life: early childhood, young adulthood, independence. Each step acts as a column; anything below it roughly corresponds to the mindsets and support offered at that moment.

Below the steps are building blocks and barriers to successful transition; the moments that matter when individuals weigh their options, make tough choices, and patch together their care; the distinct actions individuals and their families engage in throughout their life, and the varying levels of government support needed, from federal all the way down to the local levels.

These are actions or mindsets that were conducive or detrimental to successful transition from childhood to adulthood. Although everyone has a different story and therefore a different combination of these blocks, any actions taken by our federal programs to promote the building blocks or remove the barriers would improve the experience.

Lastly, at the bottom we have Cross-Agency Challenges that summarize what we learned from individuals about navigating this process. Issues about fragmented services, over-emphasis on fraud prevention, losing guardianship rights, disjointed eligibility criteria, reactive instead of proactive, and further understanding the stressful times families are in when caring for those intellectually disabled.

We look forward to providing additional updates in this space – you can follow our work at performance.gov/cx/.
