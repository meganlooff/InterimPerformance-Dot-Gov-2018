        From small businesses seeking loans, to families receiving disaster support,
        to someone passing through an airport security line -
        every interaction between the Federal government and the public is an opportunity
        to demonstrate the government understands and is meeting their needs.
        For an individual, this can mean less time in a government office,
        on the phone with a help desk, or more digestible information to support a decision.
        Collectively, throughout a lifetime of interacting with different agencies,
        these moments are powerful opportunities to show citizens their government works.
        Improving the publicâ€™s trust in government happens transaction by transaction,
        and we must act to improve every one that we can.
