        From small businesses seeking loans, to families receiving disaster support,
        to someone passing through an airport security line -
        every interaction between the Federal government and the public is an opportunity
        to demonstrate the government understands and is meeting their needs.
        For an individual, this can mean less time in a government office,
        on the phone with a help desk, or more digestible information to support a decision.
        Collectively, throughout a lifetime of interacting with different agencies,
        these moments are powerful opportunities to show citizens their government works.
        Improving the public’s trust in government happens transaction by transaction,
        and we must act to improve every one that we can.

        20 of 25 High-Impact Service Providers are reporting some feedback data.
        Most of the responses we've analyzed come from HISPs focused on healthcare: CMS and VHA.
        Six agencies provided feedback after the completion of the service, twelve provided data from a contact center, and eleven provided data collected from a website.

        While feedback data shows that interactions generally increase confidence or trust in government, there is still room to improve, and most feedback surveys are NOT administered at the completion of a service or objective. We must better instrument and collect feedback at various points along a journey, as well as at the completion of one.

        Regression analysis suggests that trust and satisfaction also correlate strongly with the effectiveness, ease, and efficiency of the interaction or interface.

      About Journey Maps
    </h2>

    <div class="usa-width-one-third">
      <h3>
        What is a journey map and how do you read it?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Journey maps serve as a summary of the voices of actual
        customers and represent their experiences at points along
        a series of steps across some time period. When reading
        this journey map, the actions show the high-level steps
        along the journey, while the other elements reveal research
        insights that can inform opportunities for improvement.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="usa-width-one-third">
      <h3>
        What is the purpose of this journey map?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Federal Customer Experience Initiative team, led by the Office
        of Management and Budget, partnered with 10+ agencies for a
        human-centered approach to improving critical moments in our
        customers’ lives. The research and production of this visual journey
        helps align our understanding of how a public service delivery system
        is experienced by the public. Through identifying common barriers,
        we can improve coordinating efforts across the Federal government.

      <h3>
        How will this journey map be used?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Although it’s difficult to re-design complex delivery systems, specific
        barriers along a journey can indicate areas that matter most to the people
        we serve. The journey shows that more broad interagency efforts (e.g.,
        on “Veterans employment”) can be slower to deliver changes than scoped
        challenge areas (e.g., “better connecting job searching platforms”). We
        plan to form interagency design teams that convene experts to prototype
        and test solutions for streamlining services.
