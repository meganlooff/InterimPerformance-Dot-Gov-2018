        From small businesses seeking loans, to families receiving disaster support,
        to someone passing through an airport security line -
        every interaction between the Federal government and the public is an opportunity
        to demonstrate the government understands and is meeting their needs.
        For an individual, this can mean less time in a government office,
        on the phone with a help desk, or more digestible information to support a decision.
        Collectively, throughout a lifetime of interacting with different agencies,
        these moments are powerful opportunities to show citizens their government works.
        Improving the public’s trust in government happens transaction by transaction,
        and we must act to improve every one that we can.

      </h3>
      <p>
        Those who have lived through a major natural disaster are facing one of the most difficult experiences they’ve ever encountered. Finding somewhere safe to live with their families, along with repairing homes and businesses amidst strained community services and school systems can all feel even more overwhelming as individuals realize the time it can take to truly recover. In these most vulnerable moments, survivors expect the government to step up and provide clear guidance and support. However, response and recovery responsibilities are spread across Federal, state, local, nonprofit, and other organizations, making it difficult for survivors to know who to turn to for what.

      </h3>
      <p>
        People with disabilities and their families receive critical support from the government, interacting with agencies at the Federal, state, and local level. At times, this can be challenging for individuals and their families to understand the full scope of what support is available and to decide what is right for them. Individuals and their families must research, apply, and weave together support from each agency individually over the course of their life.

        In 2017, over 290,000 service members
        made this transition and taxpayers spend billions of dollars
        on programs supporting veterans employment.
        Veteran employment statistics have continued to improve, but there is more to the story.
        Many veterans have jobs, but the jobs are low-wage and do not offer opportunities for advancement.

        What is a journey map and how do you read it?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Journey maps serve as a summary of the voices of actual
        customers and represent their experiences at points along
        a series of steps across some time period. When reading
        this journey map, the actions show the high-level steps
        along the journey, while the other elements reveal research
        insights that can inform opportunities for improvement.

        What is the purpose of this journey map?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Federal Customer Experience Initiative team, led by the Office
        of Management and Budget, partnered with 10+ agencies for a
        human-centered approach to improving critical moments in our
        customers’ lives. The research and production of this visual journey
        helps align our understanding of how a public service delivery system
        is experienced by the public. Through identifying common barriers,
        we can improve coordinating efforts across the Federal government.

        How will this journey map be used?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Although it’s difficult to re-design complex delivery systems, specific
        barriers along a journey can indicate areas that matter most to the people
        we serve. The journey shows that more broad interagency efforts (e.g.,
        on “Veterans employment”) can be slower to deliver changes than scoped
        challenge areas (e.g., “better connecting job searching platforms”). We
        plan to form interagency design teams that convene experts to prototype
        and test solutions for streamlining services.
