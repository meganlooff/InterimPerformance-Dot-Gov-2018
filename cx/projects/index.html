        From small businesses seeking loans, to families receiving disaster support,
        to someone passing through an airport security line -
        every interaction between the Federal government and the public is an opportunity
        to demonstrate the government understands and is meeting their needs.
        For an individual, this can mean less time in a government office,
        on the phone with a help desk, or more digestible information to support a decision.
        Collectively, throughout a lifetime of interacting with different agencies,
        these moments are powerful opportunities to show citizens their government works.
        Improving the public’s trust in government happens transaction by transaction,
        and we must act to improve every one that we can.

        20 of 25 High-Impact Service Providers are reporting some feedback data.
        Most of the responses we've analyzed come from HISPs focused on healthcare: CMS and VHA.
        Six agencies provided feedback after the completion of the service, twelve provided data from a contact center, and eleven provided data collected from a website.

      <p>
        While feedback data shows that interactions generally increase confidence or trust in government, there is still room to improve, and most feedback surveys are NOT administered at the completion of a service or objective. We must better instrument and collect feedback at various points along a journey, as well as at the completion of one.

        Regression analysis suggests that trust and satisfaction also correlate strongly with the effectiveness, ease, and efficiency of the interaction or interface.
