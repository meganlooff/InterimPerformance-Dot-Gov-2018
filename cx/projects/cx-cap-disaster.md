Meet Shanice. She lives in Louisiana with her husband and three children and runs a restaurant on the first floor of her home. During a hurricane in 2019, her family “ignored the warnings and decided not to evacuate”. She remembers “I was in bed and someone was running down the street saying flood, flood, flood! I jumped up and put my feet on the floor and landed in a puddle of water.”

They were able to make it to the school, which was two blocks  away. As they were driving, water was coming into their car and they had to abandon it and walk. When Shanice and her family returned home, they found her restaurant destroyed. She called the FEMA hotline to register and was afterwards instructed to apply for an SBA loan. She thought SBA could help her as a small business but didn’t realize they could also provide loans to individuals as well. After her evaluation, she was thrilled to quickly receive a notice that she qualified for an SBA loan.

Shanice considers herself lucky. It has taken several of her friends years to receive financial assistance after filing multiple appeals and being routed back and forth between agencies.

People who live through a natural disaster receive critical support from the government, interacting with agencies at the Federal, state, and local level; along with insurance companies, charities, and nonprofits. At times, this can be challenging for individuals and their families to understand the full scope of what support is available and to decide what is right for them. During the application process, survivors are in a state of crisis and struggle to navigate complex government processes.

The federal government currently spends $106.3 billion dollars annually on natural disaster assistance. In 2017 alone, 8% of the U.S. population was impacted by a national declared disaster.

This journey shows a person who has gone through the process of getting disaster assistance.
Those who have lived through a major natural disaster are facing one of the most difficult experiences they’ve ever encountered. Finding somewhere safe to live with their families, along with repairing homes and businesses amidst strained community services and school systems can all feel even more overwhelming as individuals realize the time it can take to truly recover. In these most vulnerable moments, survivors expect the government to step up and provide clear guidance and support. However, response and recovery responsibilities are spread across Federal, state, local, nonprofit, and other organizations, making it difficult for survivors to know who to turn to for what.

Orienting ourselves to the general process of a disaster survivor receiving support from the perspective of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Small Business Administration, Housing & Urban Development, Department of Health and Human Service, Social Security Administration, and the Department of Agriculture helped us identify subject matter experts and appropriate offices to interview.

We were fortunate to work with an outstanding team, many of whom have done previous design work, to build the critical first layer of qualitative customer data. 40 interviews with not only members of the public who have survived a natural disaster, but also charities, nonprofits, insurance companies, family members, and government employees at various levels. We supplemented this research by collecting 334 responses from a surveying the intellectual disability community with questions related to better understanding their experience navigating support services at the federal, state, and local level. We compiled this data and used it in 5 iterative design sessions with 20+ federal employees involved in the disaster response and recovery.

This journey map is a composite of the experiences of the people we spoke with, and shows the steps and support as they articulated them. This map has five sections:

At the top are the stages of time a disaster survivor experiences leading up and after the disaster event. Each step acts as a column; anything below it roughly corresponds to the mindsets and support offered at that moment.

Below the steps are building blocks and barriers to successful transition; the moments that matter when individuals are understanding what just happened, actions that they have to take to protect and recover themselves and their families, and the process of trying to apply and receive assistance from various government agencies, insurance companies, charities, and nonprofits.

These are actions or activities that were conducive or detrimental to successful support of a survivor. Although everyone has a different story and therefore a different combination of these blocks, any actions taken by our federal programs to promote the building blocks or remove the barriers would improve the experience.

Lastly, at the bottom we have Cross-Agency Challenges that summarize what we learned from individuals about navigating this process. Issues about fragmented services, things that could have been prevented, the stress that families are currently in when natural disaster strikes, over-emphasis on fraud prevention, disjointed eligibility criteria, and families not sure what to ask for and who to ask when it comes to resources available to them.

We look forward to providing additional updates in this space – you can follow our work at https://performance.gov/cx/.
